ATLauncher API Implementation
=============================

### What is it?
Open-source implementation of the ATLauncher API.

## Collaborators
The only person but myself who has access to modify this project without having to make pull requests, is RyanTheAlmighty, I have given him collaborator permission if in the unlikely case he wishes to fix or amend something in the code.

### Things to Note
I am sorry if you find this poorly-coded, a bad-implementation, however on my behalf I barely ever do PHP and this is the largest project I have done in it.

### Pluging In Your Data

To get started with the code and plug in your own data, you need to create a db.php file. Below is a starter to get you going:

    <?php
		$host = 'host';
		$user = 'user';
		$password = 'password';
		$database = 'db';
	?>
